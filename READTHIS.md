This program is intended as an easy way to produce a README file for your project. It takes several parameters, inserted by you via command line, and then writes a file called README.md. Simple.

## Instructions
Download the package as a folder and run in command line with node index.js.

## Usage
Input the requested arguments as they come up in command line.  
A demo can be viewed in [this video](https://youtu.be/RYZylQWsaC4).

## Contributing
If you have suggestions or any contributions to make, you can contact me at the contact info below, or fork the project and do it yourself. This will be licensed under the MIT license, so use away.

## Tests
If an empty response is input, including whitespace characters, the program should respond using inquirer's built-in validate method, asking for re-input.
